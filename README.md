# Hi, I‚Äôm @RND332 üëÅ
<p>Shizo, programmer, gamer, and a lot of other things.</p>
<p>Favorite character in APEX, Bloodhound.</p>

The fear of **poverty**, **surveillance** and **control** by the state and corporations, force me to develop decentralized blockchain solutions for economic problems, and decentralized and protected information exchange to solve privacy problems.

## üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...
 - Distributed systems: computing, storage, rendering, machine learning, data transmission. 
 - Anti-fraud bypass: emulation, data hiding, scraping data from social networks to train humanoid AI. 
 - AI training of artificial intelligence to attack the socio-political system. (PM if you are a cyber terrorist)
 - Creation of private overlay networks for the transmission of encrypted data that cannot be intercepted and decrypted e.g [nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) 
 - MetaDAO, a system for decentralizing power in DeFi/GameFi projects
 - ZNAK, a financial instrument with the stability of a stablecoin, and the profitability of bitcoin
 - Multi Social Network, a service for synchronizing all social networks with the possibility of backup in a decetalized network. To take away from corporations the right to delete information
 - <p>Decentralized alternatives for Everything, some examples:</p>
